# deeplearning-ai-notebooks
Contains all the code that I implemented while doing the short courses. I might have played around with some.

So far it has notebooks from: 

- Building Multi-Agent Models with CrewAI
- Retrieval Optimization: Tokenization to Vector Quantization by dQuant
- Prompt Compression and Query Optimization by MongoDB
